So you want to control some mains electrical (or lower voltage) item using your phone, perhaps? This single ESP8266 plug-in controls a relay that is built in to the module.

An Android app (.apk) allows you to configure the relay to switch on and off (toggle) or have a momentary action. All well and good then. Well, **not really**. Watch the video to find out what they did wrong and how a small Arduino (eg Nano or even an ATTiney85) comes to the rescue!

The Arduino sketch is right here in the Github repository (simple would be too complex a word to describe it!).
